          <h2>ASIC Verification</h2>
          <p>Modern ASIC chips are highly complex and contain millions of transistors, thus, the likelihood of having an error somewhere in the chip during the design process is very high. The earlier the error is detected, the less it will cost. Therefore, ensuring the ASIC is bug free as early as possible, preferably during the design process is extremely important. <br> <br>
            The goal of ASIC verification is to make sure that the design meets the system requirements and specifications. <br><br>
            Sigmaedge has one of industry’s strongest teams in design verification. Our team can execute verification from scratch of complex SoC’s and IP’s by using latest methodologies such as SV-UVM, UPF and meeting key KPI such as 100% functional and code coverage Advanced IP & SoC Verification.</p>

          <h4>Assertions, Coverage and Formal Verification</h4>
          <p>The Global semiconductor Embedded services market is supposed to grow to $109.4 billion by 2026, growing at CAGR of 5.79% from 2021 to 2026. This increasing growth of the semiconductor embedded service market is mainly driven by the increasing demand for technologically advanced electronic products across various industries. <br> <br>
            Such a growing demand for electronics makes opportunities for various service types such as field programmable gate array design, ASIC design, SoC design, product development services, verification and validation safety testing services, etc. <br> <br>

          <h2>Emulation</h2>
          <P>Latest Multimillion complex Design and SOCs have varying need for Emulation platforms to qualify Firmware, Performance measurements and Benchmark Analysis in pre-silicon phase before the silicon is taped out. <br><br>
            The complex test and use case scenarios (which are not only time consuming and difficult in simulation environment) can be easily verified in Emulation platform. This aids in reducing the verification effort as well as enhances confidence in terms of performance, latency and benchmark analysis. This also exposes RTL and Design bugs which are difficult to reproduce in RTL verification environment. <br><br>
            Sigmaedge emulation team has successfully delivered multiple projects in Emulation domain. We at Sigmaedge bring expertise in latest and various Emulation platforms like Palladium from Cadence, Synopsys Zebu, Mentor Graphics Veloce emulation systems and latest Xilinx FPGA.</P>

          <p>Expertise in place & route for block build/full chip development with timing closure using industry-standard tools for tasks like Synthesis, Floor Plan, Placement, CTS, Signal Integrity, IR Draw, EM, Low Power Checks, and Signoff checks. Extensive Knowledge in physical verification like DRC, LVS, Antenna, and Density in the latest nodes like 14nm, 10nm, 7nm, 5nm, 3nm.</p>
          <h4>STA (Static Timing Analysis)</h4>
          <p>STA (Static Timing Analysis) is one of the most important area in Semiconductor chip Designing. Having an in-depth knowledge and exposure in STA provides opportunity in exploring and understanding how other domains operate to design chip. As expert say Timing and Performance is almost everything, STA turns out to be the single most important domain which collaborates with every other areas of chip designing.</p>
